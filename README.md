- 👋 Hi, I’m @torland-klev, but my friends and everyone else calls me Henrik!
- 👀 I’m primarily interested in heavy _computer sciency_-stuff, but I also make really cool websites! Love working with Java/Kotlin and React+TS, but I have written my fair share of code in Python, MatLab, R, etc. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning technologies such as blockchain and AI, but also some more common tools like WebPack, AJC and Maven. The former because _computer sciency_, and the latter because I've spent enough hittings things until they work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on *anything*! Seriously, I'm always open for checking out new stuff; if you need a developer on a project, hit me up!
- 📫 You can reach me at either my private email <klevhenrik@gmail.com>, my academic email <henriktk@uio.no>, or my work email <henrik.klev@visma.com>. I usually respond always, unless I don't.
